**Academic Integrity and Plagiarism**

Avoid Plagiarism: Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Do not copy solutions or content from external sources without proper attribution. Always credit the original authors if you refer to their work.

Cite Sources: If you use external resources (such as textbooks, online materials, or other studentsâ€™ work), provide clear citations. Properly cite any code, formulas, or ideas that are not your own.

Collaboration: Collaboration is encouraged, but it should be within the boundaries set by the course. Discussing concepts and problem-solving strategies with classmates is beneficial, but the final work you submit must be your own.
